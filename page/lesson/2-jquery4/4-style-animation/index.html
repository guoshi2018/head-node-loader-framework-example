      <p>
        Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this
        continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the
        proposition that all men are created equal.
        <span class="more">. . .</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation,
        or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are
        met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a
        portion of that field as a final resting-place for those who here gave
        their lives that the nation might live. It is altogether fitting and
        proper that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we cannot
        dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow, this ground.
      </p>
      <a href="#" class="more">show/hide more</a>
      <p>
        The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here have consecrated
        it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little
        note, nor long remember, what we say here, but it can never forget
        what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated
        here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far
        so nobly advanced.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining
        before us&mdash;that from these honored dead we take increased
        devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of
        devotion&mdash;that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not
        have died in vain&mdash;that this nation, under God, shall have a new
        birth of freedom and that government of the people, by the people, for
        the people, shall not perish from the earth.
